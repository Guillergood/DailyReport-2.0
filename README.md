# DailyReport-2.0

DailyReport-2.0 emerges the need to update a volunteer project I carried out for Dublin Zoo in 2019, DailyReport  (work is currently under way to put it in a public repository).

This project helps zoo workers because they need to keep a series of daily animal health reports, contained in section 9 of Irish ISMZP In 2016 and in turn listed in section 2.6 of the European Directive on Good Zoo Practices.

Previously, the zoo generated a significant expenditure of resources to generate daily reports. With this tool you can report directly with any device (mobile, tablet,computer) and be collected on the zoo server and then generate a document with all the annotations.

The main objectives of this tool are:

* Streamline report generation.
* Save on costs and time.
* Allow decision-making based on information generated by daily reports.

Spring is to be used to develop the project.
